# BrightScript_PC-ROKU
A Project that will be able to run a operating system, with word proccesing. The development will start with a browser instead of a whole OS, but I will so that after the browser!
This roject is meant to convert your ROKU TV not Box, nor stick. As this project is open source, commiting to the projectwill be available through the discord server. 

This project is being made by myself with starting at 0 knowledge of the BrightScript Language. 
I am hopeful someone can commit help, you may make branches to modify the current project.
